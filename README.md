# Admin Panel - Angular Application

## Overview

This project is a responsive admin panel built with Angular. It allows users to manage products and categories with role-based access control. The admin panel is fully responsive, making it accessible across different devices. It includes API integrations for managing product and category data.

## Features

- **Role-Based Access Control:** Users with appropriate roles can log in and manage products and categories.
- **Products Management:** View, add, edit, and delete products via a user-friendly interface.
- **Categories Management:** Manage product categories, including adding, editing, and deleting categories.
- **Sidebar Navigation:** A dynamic sidebar for easy navigation between different sections of the admin panel.
- **Responsive Design:** Built with Tailwind CSS to ensure the application is responsive on all devices.
  
## Technology Stack

- **Angular** (Version 14)
- **RxJS** for reactive programming and API requests
- **Tailwind CSS** for responsive design
- **Nginx** for serving the application in production
- **Docker** for containerization

## Prerequisites

- **Docker** installed on your system
- **Node.js** (for local development)

## Installation

### Local Development Setup

# Areas for Improvement

While the current implementation satisfies the basic requirements of the admin panel, there are several areas where the project can be improved for scalability, maintainability, and performance:

1. **Generic Confirmation Modal**
   - **Current Status**: The delete functionality currently uses a custom confirmation modal tailored to specific actions (e.g., deleting products or categories).
   - **Improvement**: A more scalable solution would be to create a generic confirmation modal component. This modal could be reusable across the application, receiving parameters such as the action to confirm (delete, update, etc.), dynamic messaging, and callback functions to handle specific actions.
   - **Benefit**: This would reduce redundancy and make future feature implementations easier and faster.

2. **State Management with NgRx**
   - **Current Status**: State is currently managed within individual components using services and RxJS for data fetching.
   - **Improvement**: Implementing NgRx for state management would centralize application state, making it easier to maintain as the application scales. It would also allow for advanced features like time-travel debugging, memoized selectors, and better separation of concerns.
   - **Benefit**: Using NgRx would improve scalability, especially in applications with more complex user interactions and state transitions.

3. **Lazy Loading Optimization**
   - **Current Status**: The current implementation supports lazy loading for some modules (e.g., products, categories).
   - **Improvement**: Consider improving lazy loading by dynamically importing components only when required. Additionally, lazy loading can be enhanced with preload strategies to ensure critical components are available when needed.
   - **Benefit**: This would improve the initial load time, leading to better performance on slower networks and devices.

4. **Improve Error Handling**
   - **Current Status**: Error handling is implemented at the service level but could be enhanced.
   - **Improvement**: Implement global error handling via Angularâ€™s ErrorHandler service to capture and log application-wide errors. Display user-friendly error messages and integrate logging mechanisms such as Sentry or Elastic Stack for error tracking.
   - **Benefit**: Better user experience and debugging, as well as more structured error reporting.

5. **Implement Unit Tests for All Components**
   - **Current Status**: Basic unit tests are implemented for some components.
   - **Improvement**: Increase test coverage by writing comprehensive unit tests for all components, services, and routes. Additionally, consider adding end-to-end (E2E) tests using Cypress to cover user interactions across the application.
   - **Benefit**: Improved code quality and reduced likelihood of regression issues.

6. **Responsive Design Enhancements**
   - **Current Status**: The current design is responsive but could be further optimized for smaller devices.
   - **Improvement**: Fine-tune responsive behavior by adjusting layout and component styling, especially for complex table structures and forms, using TailwindCSS or Angular Flex Layout more effectively.
   - **Benefit**: Enhanced usability across all devices, especially for mobile users.
